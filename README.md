## How to Run

This project is set up to run directly in the browser without any build steps.

1.  Ensure you have all the files and folders (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `src/`, etc.) in the same directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The project uses an `importmap` in `index.html` to load React and other dependencies from a CDN, so no `npm install` is necessary.
